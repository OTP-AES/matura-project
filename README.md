# matura-project

In this project, I will be writing a theoretical paper about two different systems of cryptography, OPT (one-time pad) and AES (advanced encryption standard).
The paper will consist of three main chapters; OTP, AES and a comparison between the two. The final chapter aims to analyze the historical transition between these two cryptographical systems.
This will be achieved by comparing both the similarities and differences between the two systems, as well as examining the transition in a historical context.
I am writing this paper using LaTeX. Therefore, the proper usage of LaTeX and the structures it enables is an important part of the project.
