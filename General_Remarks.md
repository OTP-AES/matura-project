General Remarks
===============


* Your paper might benefit from using more mathematical notation. This would
	also mean that you need a preliminaries section at the beginning which
	defines the used notations precisely.

* A preliminaries chapter/section could also help to keep the main parts more
  readable as you don't have to explain every definition that comes up. You
  could also use this section to define the core concepts used. 

* Try to give preciser definition of the most important concepts used in your
	paper. Especially, give a preciser definition of "Perfect Secrecy" and
	"OTP".

* By trying to avoid probability theory you don't provide any definition of what
    it means to choose a key randomly. This also makes it very difficult to
    proof the fact, that OTP achieves perfect secrecy. Maybe we should schedule
    a meeting to discuss the concept of perfect secrecy.

* You give both binary and alphabetical examples. Especially the examples using
  the roman alphabet help the reader to understand how the encryption works. In
  the more technical parts about perfect secrecy this gets a bit confusing. It
  might help to try to stick to one notation and only give one example in the
  other usecase. Since this chapter prepares the reader for a chapter about AES
  it's probably better to mainly stick to the binary example.
